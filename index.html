		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
		<div id="spaceCamel">
		<p>Above all else, I would describe myself as a passionate lover of learning. This has been a driving force in my life and a trait that ultimately led me to the world of technology, where there is an endless and ever changing fountain of knowledge to consume.</p>

		<h3>Why I want to work for LOA Labs</h3>
		<p>Though blockchain has been on the periphery of my radar, my real introduction to the technology came only this year from my friend, Dan Pittman, a contributing member of the Cosmos ecosystem. All preconceived notions of blockchain fell to the wayside as I researched Cosmos. I very quickly came to the opinion that blockchain is the technology of our future and Cosmos is doing it better than anyone else.
		<br><br>
		Obviously the underlying tech created by Tendermint is inherently better than its more famous forefathers, a fact not to be overlooked. However, for myself, the most exciting part about Cosmos is the ease with which users can contribute their own applications. There have been many moments in history where a new frontier avails itself to anyone bold enough to grab it. Now with Cosmos, and blockchain in general, feels like the latest iteration of the new frontier.
		<br><br>
		Not only is the technology itself exciting, it is being used by organizations like Regen, ixo, and Althea who are using it to make the world a better place. After years of working in the collections industry, I am most excited to work at LOA Labs to contribute to something I truly believe in.</p>
